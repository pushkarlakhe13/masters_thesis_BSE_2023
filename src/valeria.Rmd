The effect of dynastic politicians appears to vary across different election cycles. This is indicated by the differing signs and statistical significance of the interaction term coefficients.

Having a dynastic politician in power in 1996 is associated with a significant decrease in the growth rate of nightlights, while having a dynastic politician in power in 1999 and 2009 is associated with a significant increase in the growth rate.

The effect of having a dynastic politician in power in 2004 is not significantly different from zero at the conventional 0.05 level. This suggests that in this year, having a dynastic politician in power does not have a discernible effect on the growth rate of nightlights.

The magnitudes of the coefficients also give some indication of the size of the effects. For example, the effect in 1996 is particularly large and negative, suggesting a strong negative impact on the growth rate of nightlights in that year.
